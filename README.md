## Create blog post
To create a blog post either:
1. Manually create a file `{MM}-{DD}_{NAME}.md` in `content/posts/{YEAR}`, following the style in previous blog post files.
2. Go to [this link](https://datavetenskap.nu/newpost) to write a post which automatically renders the markdown, and then download this file with the name `{MM}-{DD}_{NAME}.md` and put it in the corresponding directory `content/posts/{YEAR}` corresponding to the current year.

Then simply push the changes to `main`.
