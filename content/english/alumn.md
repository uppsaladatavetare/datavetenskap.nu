We do not provide our own network for alumni, and are currently using the *DV* and *Datavetenskap Uppsala* groups on Facebook for contact with alumni. However, there is the [Uppsala University Alumni Network](https://www.uu.se/stod-uu/alumnnatverket/) for anyone who has studied, worked, or is working at Uppsala University.

Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students also has an alumni network where they actively work to maintain good contact with alumni.[Here.](https://www.utn.se/alumn/)
