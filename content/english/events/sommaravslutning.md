Are you tired of TAs giving you low grades and lectures that goes on and on, and never ends? Wouldn't you rather like to sit outside and be crisped by the warm sun and listen to all the little birdies sing?

Then we have something for you! Join the Sommaravslutning where we will be grilling, having a pentathlon and chilling like crazy! Start the party with a sausauge platter that will take you for a ride and you heart to flipflopp! You can also bring your own stuff to grill.

If you want food, get a ticket (free) so we know how many you are, there will be patches to buy at the event too!!!

Bring your aptite and put on your gameface, so you won't ever forget this night!

When: 4 June

Where: At Johan (Eklundshovsv√§gen 4ish)

Let's spend a last night this year together with loads of fun! See you there, XOXO DVKV
