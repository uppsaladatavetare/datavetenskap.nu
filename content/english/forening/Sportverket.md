DV's sportverk or dvsportar, is our sports event group. A main part of what this group is the ÅM(Ångströms Mästerskap) which is a competition between the different sections at Ångström. There are four different sports that are played each year. These are volleyball, floorball, football and one secret sport, before each of these the are usually trainings. 

Moreover the sportverk also holds other events, such as badminton (TO DO).
