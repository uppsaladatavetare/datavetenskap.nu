DVKV, short for Datavetenskapliga klubbverket, is the event group for the Computer Science section at Uppsala University. DVKV regularly organizes parties and other activities that students within the section might appreciate. DVKV also works to keep several traditions alive, this is done among other things by organizing Capseisa - the Swedish championships in the game of Caps that attract people from all over our long country to Uppsala to test their luck in Caps. Stay updated about upcoming events here on the website as well as on [DVKV's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DatavetenskapligaKV) or on [DVKV's instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dvkv_uppsala?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==)
