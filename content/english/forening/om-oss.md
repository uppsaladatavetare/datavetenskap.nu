Uppsala Datavetare (UD for short) is the section within UTN which represents Computer Scientists, however this is not the whole story! In addition to representing the Bachelors programme in Computer Science, we represent the:
* Master program in Computer Science
* Master program in Data Science
* Master programme in Image analysis and machine learning

We deal with study monitoring, study social issues, social activities, and other things related to data scientists in various ways.

The association is obliged to follow the statutes and regulations established by the general assembly. According to the current regulations, there are two general assemblies per year. The autumn assembly appoints the new board that takes office after New Year's and the spring assembly reviews the annual report, financial statements, and auditor's report for the previous year.
