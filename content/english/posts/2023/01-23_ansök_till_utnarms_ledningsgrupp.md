DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLY FUN AND EDUCATIONAL YEAR? Then this is something for you! Now you have the chance to develop your role as a leader, run a project from scratch and get one step closer towards work life. You get this and much more if you apply to the Management Group in Utnarm 2023.
Utnarm is UTN's job fair, which takes place in November every year. In addition to the fair, Utnarm consists of two event weeks full of inspiring events, followed by the career fair itself. Everything ends with a gasque that you will never forget.

**The positions available are:**
* GROUP LEADER OF THE MARKETING GROUP
* GROUP LEADER OF THE CORPORATE RELATIONS GROUP
* GROUP LEADER OF THE FAIR GROUP
* CONVENOR OF UTNARM

As group leader you are part of Utnarm’s management team and have a group of about five people whom you will support and lead in their work.
As the Convenor for Utnarm you will be part of the management team and will for example be responsible for Utnarm’s sustainability, committee meetings, internal communication and team buildings. You will also act as the project manager’s right hand.

***It is a requirement to be able to speak and read Swedish in the management team. However, we encourage you to apply to the committee instead. We look forward to your applications later on!***
