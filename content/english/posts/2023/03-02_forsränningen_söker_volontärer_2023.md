The beloved River Rafting and River Festival would never be possible without a small army of volunteers helping with the work. As a volunteer, you can try a ton of different tasks to spice up your resume, and as a thanks for your help you get food, soda, a patch, and an invite to a thanks-gasque! Night volonteers, raft building volunteers, and all volunteers working during the Rafting itself will also receive free tickets to Ã–G nation's Champagne Gallop! The River Rafting is an event famous across the country by the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (UTN).

Interested in organizing activities, playing with kids, hanging out in the VIP-area, working the bar, photographing, flipping burgers, or guarding the tent at night? Perhaps you want to work in security on Valborg, or you maybe dream about chilling in the morning sun as you help us put up banners around the Fyris river. **No experience is needed, and you can work a shift together with a group of friends!**
