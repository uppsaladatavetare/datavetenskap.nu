### What is Absolut Gotland?
In AG's own words (taken directly from their website): 
Absolut Gotland is a legendary party for college and university students that has been around for over 20 years. Just before the regular opening of the season, we book an entire cottage village and campsite in the best possible location on the coast of Gotland and throw a party for four days! Enjoy the spring sun from the terrace with a drink in hand, dance the night away at the nightclub, compete against other students in traditional Gotland games, explore Visby... AG offers something for everyone.

### What happens during Absolut Gotland 2023? 
* Activities and artist performances that lifts the spirit **through the roof**!
* This year there is more help and support available for those who need it.
* Thank the AG staff, because this year there are **more buses**, twice as many!
