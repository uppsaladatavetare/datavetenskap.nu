Here is a message from the Q+ group about this year's *Inspiration Day*: 

Hi 😊

Now the date for the *Inspiration Day* is set and it will be **12th of May** 🎈 We are now looking for girls who want to help plan/help before and during the day, as a small project group. You can decide yourself how much time you want to spend. Getting help from you would be worth gold!!! ✨

For those of you who do not know what *Inspiration Day* is, it is a day where we invite all girls who have applied to the IT/DV programs and show what it is like to be a student in Uppsala. 

So if you are interested or have questions and thoughts email us, qplus@it.uu.se ✉️ or write to me or Linda on Facebook! 

Hugs 💕 Israa Aly Abdou
