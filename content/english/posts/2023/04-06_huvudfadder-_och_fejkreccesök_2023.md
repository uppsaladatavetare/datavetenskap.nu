Are you interested in taking part in welcoming the new students during their first time at University? Then the Engineering and Computer Science Reception for new students is the place for you! Fortunately enough the application for **first buddy and fake student is open 4/4 - 14/4**.


**As a first buddy** you are a priceless part of the new students first time at University. You’ll be there as a safe and secure point for new students at the same time as you show them what life as a student in Uppsala is all about. As a first buddy you will be the connecting link between the TDB-reception and new students.
**As a fake student**, during the first 3 days of the reception, you will belong to a new student class where your mission is to weld the class together and make sure that no new student is involuntarily left out. To be able to apply **for fake student you have to be able to speak Swedish**.


**No previous experience is needed to apply**, the only thing we need is for you to be **excited**! All of which are a great first student involvement!
