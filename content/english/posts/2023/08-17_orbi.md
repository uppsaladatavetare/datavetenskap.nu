Attention Computer Scientists! We hope you have had a wonderful summer and are excited to go to lots of packed events now during the semester.

In order to facilitate ticket sales and marketing for our events, we will switch from Facebook events and Google Forms and instead use the app Orbi.

In Orbi, we will both market and sell tickets to our upcoming events (with some exceptions, such as the Alumni Night), so it is important that you get it asap! We will of course also continue to promote the events on instagram and the website ðŸ˜Ž.

Many of the newcomers will probably not be familiar with the app either, so it is extra important that us upperclassmen feel comfortable with it if they have questions!

If you have questions or the like, you can of course contact us club masters, and we will help you <3

Xoxo,
Linus and Kristoffer
