Dive into the new academic year with a crackling crayfish party that is louder than all the thunderstorms that Storm Hans offered during the summer!!!

Klubbverket invites you to a pool party where we say goodbye to the rain and welcome the crayfish with open arms. Come and party as if it were the last day of summer - because in Klubbverket's party tent it's always 30 degrees and brilliant sunshine!

So throw on your flip-flops, don't forget the sunscreen and join us for an evening filled with seafood and unforgettable spex!

**Bring your own food and drinks, but leave the glass bottles at home! And most importantly, don't forget your songbook!** (If you don't have one, you can buy it at the recce center).
