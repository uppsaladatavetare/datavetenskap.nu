During the Section Battle Week, Uthgård's kitchen and bar will be open from 17.30 and serve delicious drinks and food. The competitions start at **18.00 every day**. Monday to Thursday are qualification days, where the sections challenge each other and only the winning section makes it to **the final on Friday**. 

If you don't feel like competing, come anyway! Cheer for your section! Enjoy the atmosphere and get to know new people in both your own and other sections!

If you want to help make the section fight possible, sign up for a volunteer position: [here!](https://forms.gle/mgBVVN7n7oX5iBAa6).
