well all elves and gnomes!!!! ready to kick off Christmas in the very best way???? with a Christmas sittning of course!!!!

In anticipation of Christmas Eve, it's good to relax with some Christmas movies (and mulled wine) like the classic Polar express (eggnog), Home alone with an iconic cameo (Christmas beer) or the most Christmassy masterpiece of them all: Die hard (snaps straight from the bottle).
We'll see where this polar express has for final station, maybe Värmland's dance floor💃🕺, at someone else's home🔥, or maybe the jackpot, the drunk Xell💀💀💀No matter where you land this evening, it will be unforgettable, yippie ki yay motherfucker!!!
