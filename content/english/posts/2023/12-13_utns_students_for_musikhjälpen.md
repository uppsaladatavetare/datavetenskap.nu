UTN has started a joint collection box to support Musikhjälpen 2023, which this year is about ensuring that no one has to die of hunger.  

Here you can make your donation and read a little more about the collection: [UTN's students for Musikhjälpen](https://bossan.musikhjalpen.se/utns-studenter-foer-musikhjaelpen?fbclid=IwAR0rdILQ5uNEi03GDvLAvF_OXd1kzqnhb8OJF6TzDu4XER3XP86jpT49K30)

An alternative way to support without directly donating to the collection is by buying a Musikhjälpen patch. Right now it's sold in Fooajén, the profits go directly to the DV collection box. The badge costs 40 SEK and is only available in a limited edition.
