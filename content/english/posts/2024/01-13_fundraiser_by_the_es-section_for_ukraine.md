Hello DV! The ES-Section has started a very important initiative to support Ukraine, that we want to spread. Here is translated information from their section:

During the period January 22 to February 2, the ES section will host a fundraiser for a frontline hospital in Ukraine. It is a very intimate collaboration as one of the front hospital's doctors will visit the Ångström laboratory and speak during a lunch lecture that takes place on January 22 at 12:15 - 13:00 in Eva von Bahr. Everyone at Ångström is invited to participate regardless of student or not. It is also intended to have a live link to the front hospital. During the two following weeks there will be tables on the event areas in building 10 and outside the Siegbahnsalen. There you can choose to buy a badge, pin, t-shirt, sweatshirt and hoodie or donate straight away. When buying merch, all profits go to the frontline hospital. No matter how much you choose to donate, you will receive homemade fika, coffee and drinks. It is intended that the weeks will end with a live link lecture but this is preliminary and can be changed (there is a war there).

Here is the organization that makes the cooperation possible, Insamlingsstiftelsen Sverige-Ukraina: https://www.sve-ukr.se
