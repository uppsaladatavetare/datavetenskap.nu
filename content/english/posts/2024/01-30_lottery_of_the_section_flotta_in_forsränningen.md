Hello everyone in DV!
This year we have the opportunity to raffle off a section raft to @forsränningnen. If you feel compelled to be the captain of this raft through Fyrisån, just fill out the form below.

You can have 2-4 people in the raft, and you can choose between a regular raft or an environmental raft, which is a raft whose bottom is old from previous years, which is still fine to use this year.

How much does it cost to join the rafting? It costs 1500 SEK, with the possibility of more costs later when renting equipment. In addition to that, the team must also work as volunteers for the rafting at least 8 sessions of 4 hours each.

The form will close on saturday 3/2:
