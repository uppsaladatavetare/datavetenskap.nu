Are you interested in contributing to the section? Do you think you would fit in as a klubbmästare or sportis? Then please fill in this form so that you can attend an interview with the election committee. The purpose of the nomination committee is to recommend candidates at the stormöte. Even if you do not have a meeting with the Nomination Committee, you can still stand for election at the stormöte. If you are interested in both positions, please submit two responses to this form. For the position of klubbmästare, speaking Swedish is required. For sportansvarig, it is not strictly necessary but very recommended.
