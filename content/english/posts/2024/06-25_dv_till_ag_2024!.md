Hello and hope you have a great summer! Registration for Sjöslaget is now open!

**What is Sjöslaget?**
Well, it's a major cruise with students from all over the country, which of course leads to one or another party! This year it takes place between October 6-8, earlier than last year. Conveniently before the exams! You start in Stockholm and for 2 days travel to and home from Tallinn. During the trip, there will of course be opportunities for sittings, caps and much more!

**Wow what fun! Where do I sign up?**
You do it in google forms in the link here! https://forms.gle/zrqVzJGpbsJtegmK9

**I first have to talk to my friends, when do the forms close?**
There is no date yet, but you will be warned. Expect the beginning of September, but in case there is a lack of spots, it might be earlier.

**Questions?**
Questions are always welcome at dv-info@utn.se
