You might have thought that DV doesn't have any social events? That's about to change! On Thursday, October 3rd, it's time for the year's first syjunta (sewing circle)!

It's the perfect time to tackle that huge pile of a million patches, and maybe sew a leg or two in good company! We also have several patches available in Fooaj√©n for those who missed the Sting Festival, along with plenty of nice snacks and drinks!

SIGN UP HERE: https://forms.gle/k41zF1232wu248Dw5

WHEN: October 3rd, 17 dk?
WHERE: The section house
BRING: Yourself <3, your overalls, sewing kit, and possibly some dinner
