💚 Are you tired of expensive ticket prices for sittings, or maybe you just want an excuse to wear that glittery top hiding in the back of your closet? Then this is the sitting for you! At DVont BÄRing a LÄR to a GRUSfight, you get to decide the kind of experience you want based on your ticket type.

❤️ The first ticket type… well, we don’t talk about it. But if you’re feeling broke and don’t have high expectations for food, maybe Fight Club is your vibe.

🩶 More into leather and hairspray? Then you might want to dance the night away with a Grease ticket.

💜 For those who enjoy a touch of elegance and prefer dressing up in dark suits, the pricier Great Gatsby ticket is your go-to choice.
