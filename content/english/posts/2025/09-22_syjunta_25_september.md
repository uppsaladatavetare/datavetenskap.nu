Welcome to the Patch & Stitch Night - September 25th!
Now that the overalls (“ovve”) have finally been initiated, maybe you want to sew on some patches so you’ll have a nice-looking overall for all the upcoming events? Or have you collected a bunch of patches or legs that are just gathering dust?
Then this sewing session is for you! Bring your overall and tackle that pile of patches (and maybe a stray leg or two) that you have collected. There will of course be some fika available during the time that you are sewing.

When: Thursday, September 25th, 17dk.
Where: The section house (House 18, Lägerhyddsvägen 5).
Bring: Overalls, Patches(Legs) & Sewing Kit.
Hope to see you there!
