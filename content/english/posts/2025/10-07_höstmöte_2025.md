The AUTUMN ASSEMBLY is approaching!
WHAT HAPPENS AT AN AUTUMN ASSEMBLY?
At the meeting a completely new board for the section (Uppsala Datavetare) will be appointed.
Representatives for our section within UTN and the programme council will also be reelected.
Are you interested in applying for a position or know someone you would like to nominate from our section for a position?
Here you will find the nomination and application form:
https://forms.gle/LMoU72yFcQp6pRQk7
The post descriptions are posted in the regulations(this is the swedish version, please contact dv-ordf@utn.se if you want the translated version)
https://datavetenskap.nu/documents/Reglemente.pdf
In addition to being able to impact who will represent the section, the general assembly is the perfect opportunity to have your voice heard and influence what our section should focus on.
Before the assembly, you can submit motions for things that you think should be introduced/changed!
Here is a template on how to write a motion:
