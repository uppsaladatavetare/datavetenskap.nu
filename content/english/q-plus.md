Q+ is a network for girls and non-binary students in the IT and Computer Science sections. We do all sorts of fun things together, such as studying, attending events, and just having fun. 

Everyone who identifies as a girl or non-binary is warmly welcome to join us! There is a Facebook group called [Q+ Gruppen](https://www.facebook.com/groups/211087618989388) that you're welcome to join to stay updated on information and fun activities.

You can also find Q+ on instagram, [@qplusuu](https://www.instagram.com/qplusuu/).

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email *Israa Aly Abdou*, *Klara Hugo* & *My Lindenius* at qplus@it.uu.se.
