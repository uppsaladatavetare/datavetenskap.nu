*On Wednesday the 9th december Noric Couderc will hold a lunch
event/workshop to talk about the art of programming at ITC, room [TBA].
This is a joint initiative of the Gender Equality Group and the Uppsala
University ACM-W Student Chapter (UU ACM-W).*

*The event will last approximately two hours and will focus on two
parts: (There will be a break at about 13:00, so that those who need to
leave can do so.)*

*First, how artists started including computers in their process,
focusing on modern art and contemporary art. And how artists can also
benefit from using computer programming as a medium of expression.
Second, we will talk on how computer scientists and engineers can also
benefit from doing art using programming.*

*Then there will be an interactive demonstration of the Processing
framework, a programming framework that artists often use in their work,
as it is easily accessible, even to those who do not have prior
knowledge of programming, while not being too simplistic.*
