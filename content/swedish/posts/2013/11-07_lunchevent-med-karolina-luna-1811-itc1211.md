Some systems need to be extremely reliable and easy to use. Other
systems also needs to handle sandstorms, lightning, sharks or the
occasional earthquake.

I work as a software engineer in Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil
and gas service company. In my product group we create systems for
gathering, analyzing and interpreting seismic data. This gives me the
opportunity to work with interesting technology, challenging problems
involving large amounts of data and mathematical understanding and
colleagues from all over the world.

You are invited to a journey into the world of a software engineer in
the international oil and gas service industry. In this interactive
session I’ll describe what a working day can look like for a software
engineer in a large international company, where the work is done more
places than by the desk. We will talk about agile development processes,
testing and some skills that are important for a software engineer.
Curious? Please join and ask your questions!

 Welcome!
 Karolina Luna
 Software Engineer
 WesternGeco, Schlumberger
