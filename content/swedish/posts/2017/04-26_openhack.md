The registration to OpenHack Uppsala 2017 has now opened! For 48h, developers, designers and motivated people from all over Sweden will gather for a hackathon at Base10, Klostergatan 10. The focus will be to leverage Open Source code to solve challenges society faces.

During the hackathon all participants will work with different cases, all revolving around the theme JOBTECH: how can we with tech solutions better integrate people in the Swedish labor market? 

OpenHack is a non profit-event created by students with backing from Engineers Without Borders. The hackathon is free and open for everyone, and sleeping as well as food arrangements will be offered. 

Register now and take the chance to have a full weekend of coding and great ideas â€“ all for the good of humanity.
